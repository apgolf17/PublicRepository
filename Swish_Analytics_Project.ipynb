    "# Swish Analytics Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Within this assessment, I was given the pitches from the 2011 MLB season and description data for each column within the data. The goal of the assessment is to build a model that will predict the next pitch thrown. \n",
    "\n",
    "I went about this model wanting to break down the data and look at specific pitcher data and predict based on each pitcher. Each pitcher has a unique set of pitches and throws them at different rates. For example, Tim Wakefield, a predominant knuckleball pitcher who pitched for the Red Sox in 2011, has a completely different pitch profile than Mariano Rivera, a closer for the New York Yankees in 2011 who relied upon his famous cutter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I realized I wanted to breakdown by pitcher, I needed to try and find other important categorical and empirical data to add to the model. After studying the data, I thought I needed to add the following categories:\n",
    "- **pitcher_id** - identify and group by pitcher\n",
    "- **game_pk** - identifies the game id and can be used to group the pitcher_id with to find previous pitches within the game.\n",
    "- **inning** - identify the inning the pitcher is throwing in, in case earlier in games certain pitches are thrown.\n",
    "- **top** - whether the inning is at the top or bottom of the inning to show if player is on the home or away team.\n",
    "- **pcount_at_bat** - identifies the number of pitches within the at bat, belief is a pitcher may throw different pitches early within an at bat.\n",
    "- **p_throws/stand** - identifies the hand the pitcher throws with and the stance of the batter. Thought process is certain pitches may be thrown to players who bat and throw on same side or opposite side.\n",
    "- **balls/strikes/fouls/outs** - the count and number of outs during the at bat. The scenario of the at bat can determine the type of pitches thrown.\n",
    "- **type** - identifies if the pitch was either a strike, ball or in play. Used more for identifying the previous type to see if a pitcher throws a predominant pitch after a strike/ball/etc.\n",
    "- **pitch_type** - identifies the type of pitch the pitcher threw, important for understanding the types of pitcher can throw and for pitches thrown in certain scenarios.\n",
    "- **on_1b/on_2b/on_3b** - if a player is on 1st, 2nd or 3rd base. Helps in indentifying the scenario the pitcher pitches in and the pitches thrown while runners on/off base.\n",
    "- **home_team_runs/away_team_runs** - identifies the score of the game and seeing if a pitcher pitches differently in different score scenarios.\n",
    "- **zone** - zone where the pitch crossed homeplate based on the statcast data.\n",
    "- **start_speed** - speed which the ball left a player's hand based on the statcast data. Pitchers may alter speed based on previous pitch.\n"

    "I have 2 main areas for next steps within this project. First, I would like to create a function where pitcher id is the only variable needed and it will export the expected pitch. Different variables such as score, runners on base, pitch number, etc. can be added to give an even more specific prediction. Depending on the use cases, I would create a Dash app where users could select this data from dropdown menus or enter the data, or even gather real-time data from an MLB API where you can display the odds of the next pitch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, I would like to add some more intricacies into the model. For example, I think the batter can influence the types of pitches thrown. However, I do not think it is as often as people would think. For example, only few hitters, like Bryce Harper, or high-end talent probably get a different pitch selection than most major league players. Additionally, I mentioned the types of players on base may influence the type of pitches thrown. These are all minor tweaks to make the model hopefully more efficient and accurate."
